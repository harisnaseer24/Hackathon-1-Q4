# Chapter 3 Diagrams: AI-ROS Integration

This directory contains diagrams for Chapter 3: Bridging AI Agents to ROS Controllers.

## Planned Diagrams

### 1. ai-ros-architecture.svg
- Shows the overall architecture connecting AI agents to ROS controllers
- Illustrates the flow from high-level AI decisions to low-level robot control
- Highlights the different integration layers (perception, reasoning, action)

### 2. decision-to-action-pipeline.svg
- Visualizes the pipeline from AI decision making to action execution
- Shows the different processing stages: decision → planning → execution → feedback
- Includes timing considerations and real-time constraints

### 3. ai-ros-bridge-patterns.svg
- Shows different patterns for connecting AI systems to ROS (direct integration, middleware, service-based)
- Highlights pros and cons of each approach
- Includes examples for different types of AI systems (reactive, deliberative, learning-based)

### 4. safety-integration.svg
- Illustrates safety mechanisms in AI-ROS integration
- Shows emergency stop systems, safety monitors, and fail-safe behaviors
- Highlights the safety-critical decision paths

### 5. learning-control-loop.svg
- Shows the integration of learning systems with control loops
- Illustrates how AI systems can adapt and improve over time
- Includes feedback from robot performance to AI training

## Diagram Specifications

All diagrams should be:
- Created in SVG format for scalability
- Include clear labels and legends
- Use consistent color schemes matching the site's theme
- Be accessible with appropriate alt text
- Follow the color scheme defined in custom.css
