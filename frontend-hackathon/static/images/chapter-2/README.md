# Chapter 2 Diagrams

This directory contains diagrams for Chapter 2: Sensor and Actuator Data Flow.

## Planned Diagrams

### 1. ros2-communication-patterns.svg
- Shows the three main ROS 2 communication patterns: topics, services, and actions
- Illustrates the publish-subscribe, request-response, and goal-feedback-result patterns
- Highlights use cases for each pattern

### 2. sensor-data-pipeline.svg
- Visualizes the sensor data pipeline from hardware to processing
- Shows sensor drivers, message passing, and processing nodes
- Illustrates data flow rates and QoS considerations

### 3. actuator-command-flow.svg
- Shows the path from high-level commands to actuator control
- Illustrates command generation, trajectory planning, and hardware interface
- Highlights feedback loops and safety considerations

### 4. humanoid-control-hierarchy.svg
- Illustrates the hierarchical control architecture for humanoid robots
- Shows the relationship between high-level motion planning and low-level joint control
- Demonstrates different control frequencies and responsibilities

### 5. walking-pattern-ik.svg
- Shows inverse kinematics for walking pattern generation
- Illustrates foot trajectory planning and joint angle calculations
- Demonstrates the relationship between Cartesian and joint space
