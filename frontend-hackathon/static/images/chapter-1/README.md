# Chapter 1 Diagrams

This directory contains diagrams for Chapter 1: ROS 2 as the Robotic Nervous System.

## Planned Diagrams

### 1. ros2-architecture-overview.svg
- Shows the overall ROS 2 architecture with nodes, DDS middleware, and communication patterns
- Highlights the publish-subscribe, service, and action communication models

### 2. humanoid-control-hierarchy.svg
- Illustrates the hierarchical control architecture for humanoid robots
- Shows the different control levels (joint, whole-body, task, behavior)
- Demonstrates data flow between levels

### 3. node-executor-dds-interaction.svg
- Visualizes how nodes, executors, and DDS interact in ROS 2
- Shows the relationship between publishers, subscribers, and the middleware

### 4. ros2-physical-ai-integration.svg
- Demonstrates how ROS 2 integrates AI algorithms with physical hardware
- Shows the flow from sensors through AI processing to actuators

## Diagram Specifications

All diagrams should be:
- Created in SVG format for scalability
- Include clear labels and legends
