  <!-- This launch file demonstrates how to load and simulate a humanoid robot in Gazebo -->
  <!-- Note: This is a template that would need to be adapted for actual ROS 2 usage -->

  <!-- In a real ROS 2 package, you would load the URDF like this: -->
  <!--
  <param name="robot_description"
         command="xacro $(find-pkg-share your_robot_description)/urdf/advanced_humanoid.urdf"/>
  -->

  <!-- For demonstration purposes, this file shows the structure of a launch file -->
  <!-- that would load the advanced humanoid model and start simulation -->

  <!-- The actual command would depend on your ROS 2 workspace setup -->
  <!-- Example command to run manually: -->
  <!-- ros2 launch your_package launch_humanoid.launch.xml -->

  <!-- Nodes would include: -->
  <!-- - robot_state_publisher to publish transforms -->
  <!-- - joint_state_publisher for joint states -->
  <!-- - gazebo_ros spawn_entity to load the robot in simulation -->
