# Response

Created a comprehensive specification for the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Robotics module. The specification includes:

- User scenarios for understanding VLA Systems architecture, implementing Voice-to-Action capabilities, and developing Cognitive Planning systems
- Functional requirements covering all aspects of VLA systems documentation
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes for the learning objectives
- Key entities related to VLA systems and robotic control
- A quality checklist to ensure the specification meets standards

The specification was created in the file specs/2-vla-robotics/spec.md and is ready for the planning phase.
