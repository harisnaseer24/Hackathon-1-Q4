# Prompt

```
Module: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Plan:
1. Create a dedicated **Module 4 section** in Docusaurus with three chapter `.md` files and sidebar entries.
2. Write chapters covering VLA architecture, voice-to-action pipelines using Whisper, and LLM-based cognitive planning and action sequencing.
```

# Response

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Robotics documentation module:

- Developed a detailed plan.md outlining the approach, technical context, and project structure
- Created research.md with key information about VLA systems
- Created quickstart.md with step-by-step instructions for implementing the documentation
- Created data-model.md defining the structure and content for each chapter

The plan includes three new chapters (11, 12, 13) following the existing pattern in the Docusaurus documentation structure, each with multiple sub-topics that align with the specification requirements for VLA Systems, Voice-to-Action, and Cognitive Planning. The implementation will target AI engineers and use Docusaurus Markdown format as required.
